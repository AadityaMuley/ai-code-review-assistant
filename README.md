## Future Plans

We plan to expand this project by integrating the following technologies:

1. **Backend:**
    - **Django:** We will use Django to create a robust backend for handling code analysis and review generation.

2. **Frontend:**
    - **React:** We will build a dynamic and responsive frontend using React to provide a user-friendly interface.

3. **Deployment:**
    - **Azure:** We will leverage Azure services for hosting the backend and frontend, taking advantage of the GitHub Student Developer Pack for free or minimal-cost hosting.

Stay tuned for updates and more detailed instructions as we implement these features!
